# Spin-Wheel

Overview:

My first original project using Vanilla Javascript and HTML/CSS. 
The project is pretty basic and is basically just a generic spin wheel where you can add segments to the wheel.

I got the idea of making this wheel as my company's annual dinner was running an event but we could not find a spin-wheel with enough customizability (yes this is a word) for our lucky draw session.

Usage:

Pretty straight forward, just spin the wheel! There is also an option to remove the spun name after the pop-up (if you decide to enable pop-up)
The wheel also offers some basic level of customization for the backdrop, wheel colours and even allows you to upload audio.

Future Developments/Improvements:

Currently there are no plans to improve on this project, it was just a starting project in my coding journey albeit a tough one when I was learning how to react documentation for chartJS features and manipulating the DOM.
